# Cal Esports - <a href="https://alined908.github.io/calesports/">alined908.github.io/calesports/</a>
Cal Esports is the official esports program of UC Berkeley and the website the university currently uses can be seen
here https://recsports.berkeley.edu/esports/. I thought the one used by the university needed a revision, so this was my attempt.
This is my first website and the goal was to learn HTML, CSS, Javascript and practice frontend design.
